3. Run the following command, if you see something like: "git version 2.5X.X." all things are good.
   ```
    - git --version
   ```

   ```
    - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    - git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
   ```

   1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   3. Select scopes: repo, workflow, read:org
   4. Copy the token (you might have to use it instead of your password in the next step)

## 3. Clone the repo
1. In the terminal (cmd), run 
    ```
    - cd C:\
    - mkdir dev
    - cd dev
    - git clone https://github.com/emklemkl/james-och-greven.git
    ```
    *You might need your PAT when cloning*

## 1. Check Your Current Branch

Make sure you're on the `master` (or `main`) branch:

   ```
   git branch
   ```

If you're not on master, switch to it:
   ```
   git switch master
   ```

## 2. Create a new branch

When you start a new task, create a branch with a descriptive name, **make sure the you stand on master/main before branching**:
   ```
   git switch -c my-new-branch-with-descriptive-name

   ```

## 3. Make Your Changes to the Files
For example, add your name to the bottom of the README.md file.
